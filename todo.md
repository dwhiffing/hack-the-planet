add system to automate playing
auto will hack cheapest node available, or wait until full, and then scan from random point with least max scan range, buy upgrades when appropriate
should have toggle

show maintanence in node panel
fix scaling up to automation
when out of points, should stop stealing from furthest away from home nodes first (can probably sort by scaling?)

upgrade to boost max scan range (expensive, milestone levels)
upgrade to boost points per tick (expensive, doubles point rate)
upgrade to reduce maintanence cost of hacked nodes

TODO: show upcoming unlock requirements for upgrades
TODO: players should get bonuses for completing certain percentages of nodes per region (gives boost to income?)
TODO: settings to improve performnace (disable animations, disable dotted lines)
